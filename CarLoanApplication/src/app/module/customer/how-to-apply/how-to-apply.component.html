                <p>
                    The traditional method of applying for a car loan requires you to visit a bank with a stack of documents, go through the tedious process and wait for days to know about the status of your loan application.

                    <h1>  And this is how it is now, with</h1>
                   <p> Just a few clicks on your smartphone to upload the required documents and get your car loan in no time! Furthermore, instead of paying a large amount of money at one time, you will be repaying the borrowed money in estimated monthly installments (EMIs).

                <p>Since you are applying for a personal loan - an unsecured loan - there will be no need to pledge collateral. Collateral is an asset (item of value) that acts as a form of security or protection for the lender to ensure repayment of the loan.

         <h2> Proper documentation</h2>
        <p> When you apply for a car loan on CASHe, you must apply with necessary documents. This is one of the primary requirements for a successful car finance application.

    <div class="factor-box">
        <h2>Credit Score</h2>
           <p> CASHe has its first industry proprietary, Social Loan Quotient, which uses AI, ML, and smart analytics to determine your credit score. The SLQ score ranges from 0 to 995, with higher scores equating to a better chance of securing a car loan.
            
            </p>

<div class="factor-box">
    <h2>Repayment History</h2>
        <p> Credit history can have a significant impact on your loan applications. Delayed payments and default status on past loans can have CASHe flag your account on the mobile app.</p>
